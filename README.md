Map Utility [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LordAkkarin/DispenserRefill.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LordAkkarin/DispenserRefill)
===============
The MapUtility plugin for your Bukkit server allows map creators to execute
a set of specific map (or world) related commands including:

* PVP (/pvp [on|off])
* Spectator (/spectator <add|remove> <player>)

The list of commands will be extended based on feature requests by mapmakers.
Feel free to post your suggestions into the issue tracker.

Compiling
---------

You need to have Maven installed (http://maven.apache.org). Once installed,
simply run:

	mvn clean install

Maven will automatically download dependencies for you. Note: For that to work,
be sure to add Maven to your "PATH".
